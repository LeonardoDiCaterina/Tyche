    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Tyche is an experimental stateless pseudo-random number generator designed to leverage the Matrix Multiply-Accumulate (MMA) instruction sets found in modern GPU Tensor Core units. Rather than operating on scalar ALU pipelines, Tyche represents its state as 4×4 matrices over $\\mathbb{Z}_{256}$ and derives independent streams directly from 128-bit thread identifiers, avoiding shared mutable state across parallel threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Design Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Guaranteed Invertibility:** Thread identifiers are embedded into $GL_4(\\mathbb{Z}_{256})$ via a triangular map with odd diagonal entries, ensuring invertibility modulo $2^k$ through a standard lifting argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quadratic Mixing:** The core transformation uses the recurrence $X_{n+1} = X_n^2 + C \\pmod{256}$, where $C$ is a fixed perturbation matrix. This introduces non-linearity absent from affine generators while remaining structurally compatible with INT8 MMA instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hardware Alignment:** Despite intermediate INT32 accumulation in hardware requiring careful precision handling, the design maps naturally to existing tensor-core operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates:\n",
    "- Period structure and fixed-point analysis over the relevant ring\n",
    "- Avalanche and spectral properties against standard test batteries\n",
    "- Throughput characteristics relative to existing stateless GPU PRNGs (Philox, Threefry)\n",
    "- Practical performance trade-offs and algebraic limitations"

    "#### 2. The Upward Carry Phenomenon: Weak Correlators\n",
    "\n",
    "Most bits show near-ideal avalanche (0.49-0.51), but localized weak correlations exist (e.g., Input Bit 3 to Output Bit 4 at 0.389 probability).\n",
    "\n",
    "This reflects an algebraic invariant: in the quadratic map $X_{n+1} = X_n^2 + W_n \\pmod{256}$, integer carries propagate strictly upward from LSB to MSB. Without rotations (incompatible with matrix FMA), lower bits mix significantly slower than higher bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Path to Resolution:** At 32 rounds, geometric pressure remains insufficient to fully saturate lower bits. However, in the tensor-core model, additional rounds are remarkably cheap. The mixing depth is a tunable parameter that trades latency for cryptographic quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Practical Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "Current mixing (32 rounds) achieves:\n",
    "- MSB-heavy avalanche suitable for many applications\n",
    "- Sufficient non-linearity for statistical PRNG use\n",
    "- Fast GPU execution exploiting tensor cores\n",
    "\n",
    "For strict cryptographic purity, increase `num_rounds` in config. For maximum throughput on GPU, current defaults balance quality and speed."
